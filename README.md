# GITHUB QUIZ 
 This is github quiz description 
## Questions 

   - Create a README.md file for your project using Markdown. The README should include a project title, a description, a list of features, and code examples.
   - You committed changes to your Git repository, but you realized that you forgot to include a critical file in the commit. Without losing your current staged changes, undo the last commit, add the missing file, and recommit with the correct message.
   - Configure a .gitignore file to exclude specific files and directories from being tracked by Git. Ensure that temporary files, log files, and environment-specific configurations are ignored.
   - You have been working on a branch named feature-login. After making several changes and committing them, you realize that the base branch main has been updated by your team. Integrate the latest changes from main into your feature-login branch, resolve any conflicts, and ensure the branch is up-to-date.
